# Exercise
* Everytime you move your body you are releasing a whole bunch of neurochemicals: dopamine, serotonin, neoandrenaline and Brain-Derived Nutropic Factor called BDNF. BDNF goes directly into hippocampus and helps brand new brain cells grow in the Hippocampus[^1]
* To stimulate hippocampus cardio work-out is required (any exercise that raises the heart rate). There are two pathways that have been studied to more BDNF - neutrophin that is increasing the growh of new hippocampal brain cells:

    1) Myokine - protein released by the muscles which passes the brain-blood barrier and stimulates the realease of BDNF in the brain. Studies where done on rats running on a treadmill. 
    2) Liver responding to the stress of the exercise, we know exercise is a stress because it releases cortizol - exercising realease ketone beta-hydroxybuterate that passes blood-brain barrier and is another stimulant for BDNF.[^2]
* Studies have shown that just 10 minutes of walk can shift the mood.[^2]
